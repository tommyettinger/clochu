# kolonize

Clojure dungeon colonization SRPG/Roguelike with many jobs.
(Kolo is the Finnish word for burrow.) You control characters
who descend into labyrinthine dungeons that have risen up
through the ground. The dungeons are (naturally) infested
with monsters, but also contain riches lying in plain
sight, like veins of gold that just popped out of the
floor.
